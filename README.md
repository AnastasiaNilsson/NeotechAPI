Neotech Edge is a cyberpunk TTRPG published by [Helmgast AB](https://helmgast.se/).
This project serves as a launching point for creating a unified core API for all digital services created for this game.


With this project I also strive to achieve the following programming goals:

* Use Test-Driven Development throughout the project to ensure all features are working as they should.
* See if I can create a version of the [Functional Core Imperative Shell](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/a-look-at-the-functional-core-and-imperative-shell-pattern-be2498da153a) paradigm, which makes heavy use of extension methods to provide some object-oriented flexibility to purely functional classes.
